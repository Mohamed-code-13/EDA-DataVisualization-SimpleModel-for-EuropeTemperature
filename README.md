# EDA-DataVisualization-SimpleModel-for-EuropeTemperature

## The Data.
#### Daily Temperature of Major Cities.
#### Daily average temperature values recorded in major cities of the world.
#### I'll be using this data set from kaggle from this <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/daily-temperature-of-major-cities'>Link</a>
#### Here I'll do some Exploratory Data Analysis and some Data Visualization. <br> Then I'll predict the temperature for 2019 and 2020.
### NOTE :- The data is so big all over the world (2 Million) so now I'll use the temperature data for just Europe (350k).

#### The mean absolute error for the model is 4.8. And the mean absolute error for the "AvgTemperature" is 51.9.
